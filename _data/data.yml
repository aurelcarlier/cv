  title: Motivations
  summary: |
    Having spent over six years in software development, I'm now looking for new technological challenges.
    As a fervent advocate of software craftsmanship, I attach great importance to code quality and code maintainability.
    I have a keen interest in DevOps practices and their cross-functional roles, both from a technical and organizational point of view.
    With my unconventional background, I'd like to put my experience to good use in the service of my passion.
